## Repository Description

This repository contains log files and example data for the MetaExploreX tool, a visualization and exploration tool designed to analyse metamorphic testing outcomes. 

## About MetaExploreX

MetaExploreX is an innovative tool that enables users to navigate through the results of metamorphic testing efficiently and effectively, allowing quick identification of specific cases where metamorphic rules were either violated or not violated. This is crucial for developers and testers to understand the behaviour of the system under test and to identify any potential issues that need to be addressed.

## **Repository Contents**

The main content of this repository is a collection of log files, which serve as input data for the MetaExploreX tool. These logs are generated from the metamorphic testing process and contain detailed information about the test cases, the expected outcomes, and the actual outcomes observed during testing. 

Please note that this repository does not contain the MetaExploreX tool itself or any source code related to it. It is intended to provide example data that can be used to understand how to use the MetaExploreX tool and to see what kind of insights it can provide.
